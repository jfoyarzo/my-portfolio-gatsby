My journey into technology began early, inspired by my father, a systems analyst. Together, we built my first PC when I was just 12—a classic IBM-compatible 486. This experience ignited my passion for computers and the evolving IT landscape. At 16, I created my first web page using HTML, solidifying my commitment to software development. Although I initially pursued a career in video editing, I continued to freelance in development, constantly learning new technologies and honing my skills.

Having transitioned into a full-time Full Stack Developer, I am eager to embrace new challenges and further my expertise.

I have hands-on experience working remotely within Agile methodologies and multicultural teams. I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Feel free to connect with me to discuss potential projects or share insights about the development world.
