I've been around computers my whole life. My father was a systems analyst, so from a very young age, I became very interested in software and hardware components. I built with him my first PC when I was around 12 years old, a good old IBM-compatible 486.  From then on my passion for computers and the IT world only grew stronger with the birth of the Internet and new technologies.  At age 16 I learned a little bit of HTML and made my first web page, and after building it I realized how much development meant to me. Even though I started pursuing another career as a video editor, I never stopped doing freelance development, even if it was as a side activity I would continue to learn new technologies and skills. Now, after undergoing a few years of training, I am becoming a full-fledged Full Stack Developer, ready to dive even deeper into this amazing world of software development.
